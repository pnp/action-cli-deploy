# CLI for Microsoft 365 Deploy
GitHub action to deploy an app using CLI for Microsoft 365

![CLI for Microsoft 365 Deploy App](./images/pnp-cli-microsoft365-blue.svg)

This GitHub Action (created using typescript) uses [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/), specifically the [spo app add](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/app/app-add/), [spo app deploy](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/spo/app/app-deploy/) commands, to add and deploy.

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---cli-for-microsoft-365-deploy) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions

- [CLI for Microsoft 365 Login](https://github.com/pnp/action-cli-login) â€“ **Required** . This action is dependant on `action-cli-login`. So in the workflow we need to run  `action-cli-login` before using this action.

#### Optional requirement
Since `action-cli-login` requires user name and password which are sensitive pieces of information, it would be ideal to store them securely. We can achieve this in a GitHub repo by using [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets). So, click on `settings` tab in your repo and add 2 new secrets:
- `adminUsername` - store the admin user name in this (e.g. user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com)
- `adminPassword` - store the password of that user in this.
These secrets are encrypted and can only be used by GitHub actions.
